    <h1>
      KNOWLEDGE AT YOUR <b>FINGERTIPS</b>
    </h1>

    <p>
      What Textpedia is can be be understood by considering a sample use case.
      <br />
      <br />
      Imagine for a moment that you're in a meeting with an important client and
      several other participants are present. The presenter or the client
      mentions a word, or phrase you have only the vaguest idea about.
      <br />
      <br />
      Because of the importance of this meeting you can't use your phone to
      research the keyword, but you know that if you don't make a note about it
      or something like that, the pressures of the day will probably cause you
      to forget. You'd really like to know what the keyword/phrase means so what
      do you do?
      <br /><br/>
      You could...
      <br/><br/>Make a reminder to yourself, imagine having to take a minute
      or so to covertly type out this reminder while the gist of the meeting
      passes you by. Not good! Trust in your memory to remember to check out the
      keyword at the end of the day. Even worse! Spend 10 seconds or less to
      type out the keyword/phrase and SMS it to Textpedia safe in the knowledge
      that when you check your mail at the end of the day, you'll have a nicely
      formatted preliminary report waiting for you. This allows you to decide
      whether or not you want to dig deeper into the subject. Awesome!
