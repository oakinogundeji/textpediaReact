      What Textpedia is can be be understood by considering a sample use case.
      <br />
      <br />
      Imagine for a moment that you're in a meeting with an important client and
      several other participants are present. The presenter or the client
      mentions a word, or phrase you have only the vaguest idea about.
      <br />
      <br />
      Because of the importance of this meeting you can't use your phone to
      research the keyword, but you know that if you don't make a note about it
      or something like that, the pressures of the day will probably cause you
      to forget. You'd really like to know what the keyword/phrase means so what
      do you do?
